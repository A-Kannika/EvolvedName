# Evolved Name Program
Evloved Name Program is a project for Data Structure course | TCSS 342 | @the University of Washington Tacoma

## Description
This program evolves strings in this world until they spell (my) name. A Genome class contains a list 
of characters from the above set representing a string in our world. A Population class contains a list of 
Genomes representing all the strings in our world. Using the principles of 
evolution to allow this population to evolve over generations until one of the strings reaches the target.

## Getting Started
- Build the linked list data structure.
- Efficiently sort a linked list.
- Follow the specification document exactly.
- Practice programming and debugging in randomized environments.
- Explore evolutionary algorithms.

## The result of the Evolved Name Program: 
- Spelled "KANNIKA ARMSTRONG" with less than 500 Generations and 0.5 second running time.
